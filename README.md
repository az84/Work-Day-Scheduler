## Introduction:

For this project we were required to Create a simple calendar application that would allow users to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Moment.js library has been utilized to work with date and time.

## Description:

- When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender
- When viewing timeblocks for the day, each timeblock is color coded to show whether it is in the past, present or future. Past hours are gray, future hours are green and the current hour is red.
- When a user clicks on the save button after entering an event into a timeblock, then that event is saved in the local storage
- Saved events still exists after the user refreshes the page
