## Description:

- When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender
- When viewing timeblocks for the day, then each timeblock is color coded to show whether it is in the past, present or future. Past hours are grey, future hours are green and the current hour is red.
- When a user clicks the save button after entering an event into a timeblock, then that event is saved in the local storage
- Saved events still exists even after the use refreshes the page
